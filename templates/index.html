    <h1>Our Modules</h1>
    <h2>Arithmetic</h2>

    <div class="arithmetic">
        {#Four cards for basic arithmetic operations #}
        <div class="column" id="box_add">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Addition</h2>
                <p>Addition is the process of combining two or more quantities to find their total. It's one of the four basic operations, fundamental for everyday calculations. (Symbol: +)</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="column" id="box_minus">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Subtraction</h2>
                <p>Subtraction is finding the difference between two quantities—essentially taking away one amount from another. It's one of the four basic operations. (Symbol: -)</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="column" id="box_multi">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Multiplication</h2>
                <p>Multiplication combines equal groups of items quickly—essentially 'repeated addition'. The numbers multiplied are called 'factors' and the result is the 'product'. It's the opposite of division. (Symbol: x)</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="column" id="box_div">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Division</h2>
                <p>Division splits a total into equal parts or determines how many times one number fits into another. It's the inverse of multiplication. In this website, we dont cover decimals so for all the division questions, it will just be to the closest whole number. (Symbol: ÷)</p>
